Hello! I'm Jennifer Pichardo and I'm an aspiring game developer currently studying Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology.
I enjoy working alongside others to help develop creative and fun projects. I'm familiar with languages such as C#, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and I have worked with Unity.
In my spare time, I draw digital illustrations, posting them on my social media.
